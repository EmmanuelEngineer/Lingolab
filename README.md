# LingoLab: Enhancing Language Learning through AI and HCI

**LingoLab** is an innovative educational platform designed to bridge the gap between students' learning needs and teachers' instructional goals. Built with a focus on enhancing the language learning experience, LingoLab combines advanced Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) techniques with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide personalized learning journeys for students and actionable insights for educators.

The platform offers a variety of interactive features, including:
- **Personalized Exercises**: Tailored activities to address individual learning gaps in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Text-based and vocal responses assessed through state-of-the-art speech recognition and gaze detection technologies.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Analysis of facial expressions and focus levels to improve student engagement and motivation.
- **Teacher Dashboards**: Visual performance statistics to aid lesson planning and adapt teaching strategies effectively.
